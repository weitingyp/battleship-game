# Battleship Game

## TLDR;
Play against another player (computer) to sink all their ships. 

## Tech used
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Git

## Features
- Randomly generate two gameboards with random ship placements
- Ships: 5, 4, 3, 3, 2 in length
- Indicate current player's turn and click the attacked player's gameboard

## Opportunities for further improvements
- Improve UI: 
    - overall look
    - current player indication is confusing
    - ability to set own ships by text coordinates or click and drop
    - indicate or list ships that have been sunk/not yet sunk
- Add strategy to computer's play
    - currently random: can strategize according to ships remaining
